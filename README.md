The project activity involves 1 x 110 TPH boiler with high pressure and temperature configuration (110
atm and 540 °C), 1 x 18 MW back pressure and 1 x 8 MW Double extraction cum condensing Turbine
Generator set. The cogeneration cycle for the plant is designed as regenerative cycle with high pressure
feed water heater and one low-pressure feed water heater. The plant is generating more than three to
four times power as compared to the power generated by the sugar mill of same capacity having
conventional low pressure and temperature steam configuration with back pressure turbines.
Although very few bagasse/biomass based cogeneration power plants are designed with above
mentioned high pressure and temperature parameters, the technology is well proven worldwide.
